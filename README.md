# Fine-Tuned BERT with Hybrid Pooling

This project presents a custom fine-tuned BERT architecture enhanced with hybrid pooling (CLS + mean + max), residual connections, and modified transformer blocks for improved representation and classification. Moreover, upon request we can share the binary classification code and dataset as required for the tasks. 

## 🚀 Features

- ✅ BERT backbone (Huggingface Transformers)
- ✅ Custom Hybrid Pooling Layer
- ✅ Modified Transformer Layer
- ✅ Residual Connections and Layer Normalization
- ✅ Easily adaptable for text classification
